# Fireman Sam Saves the World from Corona
## Explanation of the Program/Game:
The program introduces an educational game for children to learn if there happens to be a global pandemic and they are unable to continue school as usual. The player in the game (Fireman Mickey) must smash his way through wooden doors and shoot down the Corona with alcogel spray and put out at least 15 fires to get to the Fire station successfully and complete the level. If he arrives at the fire station before all the lights are lit, he will not be able to enter it. The way to light up all 5 lights, is by answering questions. Every time he puts out 3 fires, a multiple-choice question will pop up on the screen in front of him. If answered correctly, a light at the top of the screen and on top of the fire house will turn on. However, if answered incorrectly, neither will light up and the same question will pop up again the next time 3 fires are put out, until the player correctly answers the question. If the player has put out all the fire in the level and not successfully answered all the required questions, the player will lose the game. However as soon as he has correctly answered the 5 questions within the given level, he can put out as many fires as he would like, and no more questions will pop up until he continues through the station to the next level. There are three levels to the game and when the player finishes them all, he wins the game!
### Design of Program:
The different objects used in the program are as follows-
- Game Object – sets the resources for sprites/textures for all objects in the game
- Moving Object – this holds the direction for movement and the sprites
- Static Object – this holds the sprites and their scale
- Controller – this is where all the technical changes happen for the game as it runs
- Board – the game board is built and dealt with here
- Menu – the main menu and all its actions are handled here
- Toolbar – the statistics of the game throughout playing and the setting are set here
- Question – the pop up questions that occur during the game are set and kept here

#### Data Structures Used:
1. Vectors
2. lists
3. map 
4. basic array
##### Algorithms Worth Mentioning:
If his path is obstructed, the fire adversary paces back and forth until he finds a direction that he can walk. The fire enemy tracks where the player is and moves towards him.
